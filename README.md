- Each turn consists of either moving a pawn or placing a fence. Players start with 10 fences.
- Players can move one space vertically or horizontally.
- If players are face to face vertically and there are no fences between them, a player can jump over their oppoennt. If the player is blocked by the opposing pawn and a fence, they may move diagonally.
- Fences block two spaces and cannot overlap.
- Game ends when a player moves into any space touching their opponent's baseline.
